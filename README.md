## Introduction
This project is a Python-based machine learning application that analyse the market based insights.Market basket analysis is an unsupervised machine learning technique because it does not train on a dataset or predict an outcome. Instead, the algorithm identifies relationships between items and combinations of items that are frequently bought together.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found at [source_dataset_link]https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/market-basket-analysis

## Dependencies
To run this code, you will need the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive exploration)
- NumPy
